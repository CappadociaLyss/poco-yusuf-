    <h1>Benefits of OOP</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>OOP offers several benefits to both the program designer & the user</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Through inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing class</li>
            <li>We can build programs from the standard working module the communicate with one another, rather than
                having to start writing code from scratch. This leads to saving of development time & higher
                productivity.</li>
            <li>The principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build & secure programs that cannot be invaded by
                code in other parts of the program.</li>
            <li>It is possible to map objects in the problem domain to those in the program</li>
            <li>It is easy to partition the work in a project based on objects</li>
            <li>The data-centered design approach enables us to capture more
                details of a model in implementable form.</li>
            <li>Object-oriented systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.</li>
            <li>Message passing techniques for communication between objects makes the interface descriptions with
                external systems much simpler.</li>
            <li>Software complexity can be easily managed .
                While it is possible to incorporate all these features in an object- oriented system, their importance
                depends on the type of the project and the preference of the programmer. There are a number of issues
                that need to be tackled to reap some of the benefits stated above. For instance, object libraries must
                be available for reuse. The technology is still developing and current products may be superseded
                quickly. Strict controls and protocols need to be developed if reuse is not to be compromised.</li>
          
        </ul>
